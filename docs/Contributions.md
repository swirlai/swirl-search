# Contributions Guide

SWIRL welcomes contributions to AI Connect, Community Edition.

The following table identifies the major classes of contributions, and the expected level of effort. 

## SearchProviders / Connectors

We gratefully accept SPs/Connector PRs, so long as they can be tested without expense. These contributions are excellent for new to intermediate developers, and should take 1 day to 1 week with most time determined by the time to stand up a test server.

Candidates include:

* Notion (service)
* MarqoDB (vector DB)
* ChromaDB (vector DB)
* RaptorDB (vector DB)
* MySQL (relational DB)
* SQLAlchemy (relational DB package)

## Processors

We are always looking for useful Processors, including:

* Configurably apply regex replacement to results
* Lookup and replace values in query from CSV or database
* Apply ontology/taxonomy to query

These tasks should take 1-2 weeks for an intermediate to advanced developer.

## Testing & Documentation

SWIRL has an extensive automated testing system, and a decent amount of documentation. We gratefully welcome contributions in these areas, which can be very minimal effort (such as documentation updates) to quite complex. Please [contact us](#support) for more information.

## Guidelines for Submissions

* Please join [SWIRL Slack](#support) as noted below, and feel free to ask #support or #general about what you propose to contribute.

* Create a branch lways branch off of `develop` with a descriptive name that encapsulates your idea or fix.

* Create a PR following the Gitflow branching model, including all required changes.
