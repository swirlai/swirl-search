SWIRL welcomes contributions to AI Search, Community Edition. The table below outlines the major types of contributions and the expected level of effort.

# SearchProviders / Connectors

We welcome new SearchProviders and Connectors, provided they can be tested without expense. These contributions are ideal for new to intermediate developers and typically take **1 day to 1 week**, depending on test server setup time.

## Potential Candidates:
- **Notion** (service)
- **MarqoDB** (vector DB)
- **ChromaDB** (vector DB)
- **RaptorDB** (vector DB)
- **MySQL** (relational DB)
- **SQLAlchemy** (relational DB package)

# Processors

We are always looking for useful processors, including:

- **Regex-based result modifications** (configurable pattern replacements)
- **Query transformations** (lookup and replace from CSV/database)
- **Ontology/taxonomy-based query expansion**

These tasks generally take **1-2 weeks** for an intermediate to advanced developer.

# Testing & Documentation

SWIRL has an extensive automated testing system and detailed documentation. Contributions in these areas range from **small updates to major improvements**. Please [contact us](#support) for details.

# Guidelines for Submissions

- **Branch off `develop`** with a descriptive branch name.
- **Follow the Gitflow branching model** and ensure all required changes are included in your PR.
