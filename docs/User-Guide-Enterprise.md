## Search Syntax  

The following table details SWIRL's search syntax:  

| Syntax | Handling | Notes |  
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |  
| **AND, OR** | Passed down to all SearchProviders | SWIRL does not modify or verify whether a provider supports these operators. |  
| **NOT, -term** | Passed down to configured SearchProviders and rewritten if necessary; removed for providers that do not support `NOT` or `-term` | SWIRL verifies compliance and **down-weights or flags responses** that contain terms excluded by `NOT`. |  
| **tag:term** | Passes `term` to SearchProviders configured with that **Tag** in their `tags` field. The untagged portion of the query is discarded. If a query starts with `tag:`, only providers with that Tag are searched. | **Example:** `electric vehicle company:tesla` â†’ Only the term **`tesla`** is sent to SearchProviders with the `company` Tag.<br/> **Example:** `company:facebook` â†’ The query **`facebook`** is only sent to SearchProviders with the `company` Tag. |  

### AND, OR

- **AND** and **OR** operators are **passed unchanged** to all SearchProviders.  
- SWIRL does **not** verify whether a provider supports these operators or correctly applies them.  

### NOT (`NOT` and `-` Syntax)  

- `NOT` remains in queries for SearchProviders that have **`NOT=True`** in their `query_mappings`.  
  - The `NOT` operator applies to **all terms that follow it** (if the provider supports it).  

- `NOT` is rewritten as `-term` for SearchProviders that have:  
  - **`NOT_CHAR=-`** and **`NOT=False`** (or `NOT` unspecified).  
  - The `-term` applies to all terms that follow it.  

- **For SearchProviders without `NOT=True`**, `NOT` and its associated terms are **removed from the query**.  

- SWIRL **scans responses** for compliance with `NOT` statements.  
  - If a response **contains excluded terms**, its **relevancy score is reduced**.  

### Plus/Minus (`+/-`) Syntax 

- **`+` (PLUS) before a term** ensures it **must** be included in results.  
  - It is **passed unchanged** to all SearchProviders.  

- **`-` (MINUS) before a term** functions as `NOT` **for providers that support it**.  
  - If a provider has **`NOT_CHAR=-`** configured in `query_mappings`, `-term` is passed unchanged.  
  - If a provider has **`NOT=True`** but **not** `NOT_CHAR=-`, `-term` is rewritten to `NOT term`.  

- **For providers without `NOT_CHAR=-`**, all `-term` exclusions are **removed** from the query.  

## Using Tags to Select SearchProviders  

**Tags** categorize **SearchProviders** by topic, entity type, or relevant concepts (e.g., `company`, `person`, `financial`).  
These tags can:  
- **Filter SearchProviders**â€”Only tagged providers are selected when a query starts with `tag:`.  
- **Direct query terms**â€”SWIRL rewrites portions of the query based on the provider's tags.  

For example, the **funding dataset** included with SWIRL has SearchProviders for **SQLite3, PostgreSQL, and Google BigQuery**, each containing relevant **Tags**:  

```json
{
    "name": "Company Funding Records (cloud/BigQuery)",
    "connector": "BigQuery",
    ...
    "tags": [
        "Company",
        "BigQuery"
    ]
}
```

### How Tags Work in Queries  

#### 1. Filtering by Tag Only 
If a query **begins with `tag:`**, only **SearchProviders with that Tag** are selectedâ€”regardless of their `default` status.  

```shell
company:facebook
```
- This limits the query to **SearchProviders with the `company` Tag**.  
- Unrelated providers **are excluded**, even if they are `default=true`.  

#### 2. Combining a Tag with a General Query
A **default search** can be combined with a **tagged search** for specific terms.  

```shell
electric vehicle company:tesla
```
- **Default SearchProviders** receive the full query: `"electric vehicle tesla"`.  
- **SearchProviders with the `company` Tag** receive only `"tesla"`.  

For example, the **BigQuery SearchProvider** will receive:  

```shell
tesla
```

This makes **direct hits** on funding records more likely to **rank higher** in the results.

## Hit Highlighting  

SWIRL **highlights query term matches** in the following fields:  
- **`title`**  
- **`body`**  
- **`author`**  

For example:  

```json
"body": "<em>Performance</em> <em>management</em> is the process of setting goals and expectations for employees and then tracking and measuring their progress. This can be done through regular one-on-one meetings, <em>performance</em> reviews, and other feedback mechanisms."
```

## Human Language Processing in AI Search

The following table details the language processing capabilities provided in SWIRL AI Search, Enterprise Edition:

|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|**Language**|**Stemming**|**Stopwords**|**Segmentation**|**Highlighting**|**Prompts**|
|English|Yes|Yes|No|Yes|Yes|
|French|Yes|Yes|No|Yes|No|
|German|Yes|Yes|No|Yes|No|
|Italian|Yes|Yes|No|Yes|No|
|Japanese|No|No|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|Spanish|No|Yes|No|No|No|

For example, here is SWIRL AI Search showing results and RAG in Japanese:

## Confidence Scores

Starting in **SWIRL Enterprise 4.0**, SWIRL introduces a **confidence-based relevancy ranking model**. The **confidence score** ranges from **0 (not relevant) to 1.0 (extremely relevant)** and is **comparable across queries**.

### How Confidence Scores Work:

The score **factors in**:
  - **Number of matched query terms**
  - **Term importance**
  - **Contextual similarity between the query and the results**
  - **The source-reported rank**
  - **Other advanced ranking factors**

You can still **sort by relevancy** using the **`VIEW BY:`** dropdown. 

**AI Insights use only results** above a configurable minimum confidence score. 

## Alternate Sort Orders

By default, **SWIRL sorts results by Confidence Score**. To change this:  

- Click the **`View By`** dropdown.  
- Select:  
  - **`Relevancy`** - Sorts results by a raw relevancy score. This value is not comparable between queries, and is deprecated as of SWIRL 4.
  - **`Date`** â€“ Sorts results chronologically. Results without a `date_published` value are hidden.  
  - **`Top Picks`** â€“ Highlights the most relevant results from each source.  

To see all results again, switch back to **`Confidence`** sorting.  

## Filtering Results by Source  

**SWIRL returns the best results from all available sources** by default. 

To filter results, check the desired `Source` boxes as shown above. The displayed results will update instantly. 

Click `Clear All` to reset the filter and view all results.  

## Guiding Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for AI Insight Generation

SWIRL Enterprise 4.2 includes a new field on the search form: `Optional instructions for the AI response`. This field allows you to provide instructions to the LLM that will summarize the retrieved results - without having it be part of the selection criteria. The search box with the hint "What are you searching for today" determines which results are retrieved. 

For example, this query selects the top documents about Karen Sparck Jones, and instructs the configured LLM to report on major inventions.

![SWIRL RAG results for Karen Sparck Jones inventions](images/ksj_rag_example.png)

The RAG result includes [details of her invention of TF/IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) as expected.

### Using the Shopping Cart

To further guide RAG responses, use the shopping cart to manually select the results to send to the LLM for when generating AI insights.

![SWIRL AI Search result with select items enabled](images/4_1_0-SelectAll.png)

Use the `DESELECT ALL` / `SELECT ALL` link to check or uncheck all results, then adjust as desired.

### Customizing Prompts

**SWIRL AI Search (Enterprise Edition)** allows authorized users to **select a specific prompt** when generating AI Insights.

  ![SWIRL AI Search with results and RAG](images/swirl_40_search_prompts.png)

### Selecting a Prompt
- Use the **drop-down list** below the search box **before clicking** `Generate AI Insight`.

### Viewing or Editing Prompts
- Open: [http://localhost:8000/swirl/prompts/](http://localhost:8000/swirl/prompts/)  
- Or use the **[Admin UI prompts management](http://localhost:8000/admin/swirl/prompt/)**.

To modify prompts, use the **HTML form** or **Raw Data modes** at the bottom of the page.

  ![SWIRL AI Search prompts HTML form](images/swirl_40_prompt_endpoint.png)

{: .warning }
**SWIRL recommends not modifying system prompts.** If you need to reset them, follow the  
[Admin Guide section on resetting prompts](Admin-Guide#resetting-prompts).
