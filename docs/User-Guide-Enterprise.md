Read on to learn more about the SWIRL AI Search Assistant's capabilities!

### Understanding Prompts

SWIRL prompts consist of three key components:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `prompt` | The main body of the prompt. Use `{query}` to represent the SWIRL query. |
| `note` | Text appended to RAG data chunks, annotated by the [Text Analyzer](#text-summarization). |
| `footer` | Additional instructions appended after the prompt and RAG data. This is ideal for formatting guidance. |

The name of the `prompt` has no importance. SWIRL uses the `tags` field to determine which prompt is used for a given function. 

The following table presents the `tags` options:

| Tag | LLM Role | 
| --- | -------- | 
| chat | Used by AI Search Assistant for chat conversations, including company background; not technical | 
| chat-rag | Used by AI Search Assistant to answer questions and summarize data via RAG; somewhat technical | 
| search-rag | Used by AI Search, `Generate AI Insight` (RAG) switch, somewhat technical | 

### Viewing Prompts

- Any user may view the prompts endpoint: [http://localhost:8000/swirl/prompts/](http://localhost:8000/swirl/prompts/)  

- Admins may use the [Admin Tool - Manage Prompts](http://localhost:8000/admin/swirl/prompt/) interface.

### Modifying Prompts

Administrators can modify prompts, as follows: 
- [Customize the SWIRL AI Search Generate AI Insight RAG prompt](AI-Search.html#customizing-the-ai-search-rag-prompt)
- [Customize the SWIRL AI Search Assistant prompts](AI-Search-Assistant.html#customizing-the-ai-search-assistant-prompts)

## Deep Linked Citations

When possible, the Assistant will link directly to the relevant section of a web page used in a RAG response, and highlight it. 

![SWIRL Citations with Deep Links](images/4_3_0-Deeplinking-1.png)

The first citation is a page on EY.com:

![Deep Link Example #1](images/4_3_0-Deeplinking-2.png)

The second citation is on the IMF site:

![Deep Link Example #2](images/4_3_0-Deeplinking-3.png)

## Generating Complex Queries

SWIRL Assistant can generate queries in **any query language** supported by the underlying model.  
For example, OpenAI's latest models can generate queries using most **SQL dialects**:

  ![SWIRL Assistant querying Google BigQuery using SQL](images/swirl_40_chat_SQL.png)

Other supported query languages include:

- **MongoDB MQL**
- **OpenSearch**
- **Elastic ESQL**
- **OpenSearch Query DSL**
- **Solr syntax**  
  
{: .highlight }
For assistance with specific query languages, please [contact SWIRL](mailto:support@swirlaiconnect.com).

## Human Language Support

SWIRL Assistant can **converse and query** in any language supported by the underlying model. For example, OpenAI's latest models can converse in **100+ languages**:

  ![Querying SWIRL Assistant in Japanese](images/swirl_40_chat_query_in_japanese.png)

  ![Asking Assistant to translate an English response to Japanese](images/swirl_40_chat_translate_response_to_japanese.png)

## Other Model Capabilities

SWIRL Assistant does not limit **LLM capabilities**. You can:

- **Summarize** a Assistant chat in various formats (e.g., bullet points, narrative, iambic pentameter), as long as it is within the same chat session.
- **Translate** Assistant responses into other languages.
- **Reformat, revise, or retry** responses.
- **Use memory** to retain information across chat sessions (if supported by the model).

## Handling Errors

Sometimes, Assistant **won't find results**. Don't be alarmed! Try the following:

- **Correct the query**
- **Remove specific terms**
- **Simplify the search**
- **Try a different source**
- **Run the search again**

  ![SWIRL Assistant correcting a spelling error](images/swirl_40_chat_try_different_query.png)

{: .warning }
When querying with **SQL** or other structured query languages, **some models may require occasional correction**:

  ![SWIRL Assistant having SQL corrected by user](images/swirl_40_chat_correct_query.png)

Please [contact support](#support) for assistance using the Assistant with any advanced query language.

## Ending a Chat Conversation

To **end a conversation**, click the **SWIRL logo** at the top of the page. This starts a **new conversation**.

Read on for more information about these capabilities.

## Search Syntax  

The following table details SWIRL's search syntax:  

| Syntax | Handling | Notes |  
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |  
| **AND, OR** | Passed down to all SearchProviders | SWIRL does not modify or verify whether a provider supports these operators. |  
| **NOT, -term** | Passed down to configured SearchProviders and rewritten if necessary; removed for providers that do not support `NOT` or `-term` | SWIRL verifies compliance and **down-weights or flags responses** that contain terms excluded by `NOT`. |  
| **tag:term** | Passes `term` to SearchProviders configured with that **Tag** in their `tags` field. The untagged portion of the query is discarded. If a query starts with `tag:`, only providers with that Tag are searched. | **Example:** `electric vehicle company:tesla` → Only the term **`tesla`** is sent to SearchProviders with the `company` Tag.<br/> **Example:** `company:facebook` → The query **`facebook`** is only sent to SearchProviders with the `company` Tag. |  

### AND, OR

- **AND** and **OR** operators are **passed unchanged** to all SearchProviders.  
- SWIRL does **not** verify whether a provider supports these operators or correctly applies them.  

### NOT (`NOT` and `-` Syntax)  

- `NOT` remains in queries for SearchProviders that have **`NOT=True`** in their `query_mappings`.  
  - The `NOT` operator applies to **all terms that follow it** (if the provider supports it).  

- `NOT` is rewritten as `-term` for SearchProviders that have:  
  - **`NOT_CHAR=-`** and **`NOT=False`** (or `NOT` unspecified).  
  - The `-term` applies to all terms that follow it.  

- **For SearchProviders without `NOT=True`**, `NOT` and its associated terms are **removed from the query**.  

- SWIRL **scans responses** for compliance with `NOT` statements.  
  - If a response **contains excluded terms**, its **relevancy score is reduced**.  

### Plus/Minus (`+/-`) Syntax 

- **`+` (PLUS) before a term** ensures it **must** be included in results.  
  - It is **passed unchanged** to all SearchProviders.  

- **`-` (MINUS) before a term** functions as `NOT` **for providers that support it**.  
  - If a provider has **`NOT_CHAR=-`** configured in `query_mappings`, `-term` is passed unchanged.  
  - If a provider has **`NOT=True`** but **not** `NOT_CHAR=-`, `-term` is rewritten to `NOT term`.  

- **For providers without `NOT_CHAR=-`**, all `-term` exclusions are **removed** from the query.  

## Using Tags to Select SearchProviders  

**Tags** categorize **SearchProviders** by topic, entity type, or relevant concepts (e.g., `company`, `person`, `financial`).  
These tags can:  
- **Filter SearchProviders**—Only tagged providers are selected when a query starts with `tag:`.  
- **Direct query terms**—SWIRL rewrites portions of the query based on the provider's tags.  

For example, the **funding dataset** included with SWIRL has SearchProviders for **SQLite3, PostgreSQL, and Google BigQuery**, each containing relevant **Tags**:  

```json
{
    "name": "Company Funding Records (cloud/BigQuery)",
    "connector": "BigQuery",
    ...
    "tags": [
        "Company",
        "BigQuery"
    ]
}
```

### How Tags Work in Queries  

#### 1. Filtering by Tag Only 
If a query **begins with `tag:`**, only **SearchProviders with that Tag** are selected—regardless of their `default` status.  

```shell
company:facebook
```
- This limits the query to **SearchProviders with the `company` Tag**.  
- Unrelated providers **are excluded**, even if they are `default=true`.  

#### 2. Combining a Tag with a General Query
A **default search** can be combined with a **tagged search** for specific terms.  

```shell
electric vehicle company:tesla
```
- **Default SearchProviders** receive the full query: `"electric vehicle tesla"`.  
- **SearchProviders with the `company` Tag** receive only `"tesla"`.  

For example, the **BigQuery SearchProvider** will receive:  

```shell
tesla
```

This makes **direct hits** on funding records more likely to **rank higher** in the results.

## Hit Highlighting  

SWIRL **highlights query term matches** in the following fields:  
- **`title`**  
- **`body`**  
- **`author`**  

For example:  

```json
"body": "<em>Performance</em> <em>management</em> is the process of setting goals and expectations for employees and then tracking and measuring their progress. This can be done through regular one-on-one meetings, <em>performance</em> reviews, and other feedback mechanisms."
```

## Confidence Scores

SWIRL Enterprise uses a **confidence-based relevancy ranking model**. 

The **confidence score** ranges from **0 (not relevant) to 1.0 (extremely relevant)** and is **comparable across queries**.

### How Confidence Scores Work:

The score **factors in**:
  - **Number of matched query terms**
  - **Term importance**
  - **Contextual similarity between the query and the results**
  - **The source-reported rank**
  - **Other advanced ranking factors**

You can still **sort by relevancy** using the **`VIEW BY:`** dropdown. 

**AI Insights use only results** above a configurable minimum confidence score. 

## Managing Prompts

SWIRL prompts consist of three key components:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `prompt` | The main body of the prompt. Use `{query}` to represent the SWIRL query. |
| `note` | Text appended to RAG data chunks, annotated by the [Text Analyzer](#text-summarization). |
| `footer` | Additional instructions appended after the prompt and RAG data. This is ideal for formatting guidance. |

### Viewing Prompts

- Any user may view the prompts endpoint: [http://localhost:8000/swirl/prompts/](http://localhost:8000/swirl/prompts/)  

- Admins may use the [Admin Tool - Manage Prompts](http://localhost:8000/admin/swirl/prompt/) interface.

### Modifying Prompts

Request new prompts, or modifications to existing ones, from SWIRL administrators. 

- [Customize the SWIRL AI Search Assistant prompts](AI-Search-Assistant.html#customizing-the-ai-search-assistant-prompt)
- [Resetting SWIRL AI prompts](./Admin-Guide.md#resetting-prompts)

## Guiding Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for AI Insight Generation

SWIRL Enterprise 4.2 includes a new field on the search form: `Optional instructions for the AI response`. This field allows you to provide instructions to the LLM that will summarize the retrieved results - without having it be part of the selection criteria. The search box with the hint "What are you searching for today" determines which results are retrieved. 

For example, this query selects the top documents about Karen Sparck Jones, and instructs the configured LLM to report on major inventions.

![SWIRL RAG results for Karen Sparck Jones inventions](images/ksj_rag_example.png)

The RAG result includes [details of her invention of TF/IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) as expected.

### Using the Shopping Cart

Click `Select Items` to manually select the result to use during RAG.

![SWIRL AI Search result with select items enabled](images/4_1_0-SelectAll.png)

Use the `DESELECT ALL` / `SELECT ALL` link to check or uncheck all results, then further adjust as desired. 

Click the `Generate AI Insights` switch to send the selected items to the AI/LLM for response.

## Deep Linked Citations

When possible, AI Insights generated using the Search form will deep link directly to the relevant section of a result used in a RAG response, and highlight it. 

Refer to the [section on Deep Linking](#deep-linked-citations) above for more information.

## Starting a New Search
